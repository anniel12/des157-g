 <p>I wanted to make a online travelling app so adults will<br>
   go out for often and explore. My app could detect<br>
   and track the user from one location to another, locate famous<br>
   landmarks of the location, and also store pictures.<br>
   My feedback was great but not sure if these are too much<br>
   features and stray a bit from the purpose. Also coding<br>
   might be diffcult to do.
