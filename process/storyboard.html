 <p>I wanted to make a online travelling app so adults will
   go out for often and explore. My app could detect
   and track the user from one location to another, locate famous
   landmarks of the location, and also store pictures.
   My feedback was great but not sure if these are too much
   features and stray a bit from the purpose. Also coding
   might be diffcult to do.
