    <p>	During my college years, I have always received emails about traveling abroad. At that time, I have a lot going on and do not seem to consider these opportunities until my senior year. I always think I should graduate first, get a job, save money, then go on vacations. However, travelling does not have to do with age. In fact, some say the earlier you learn the lesson travel teaches you, the better. </p>

    <p>		We may be young and still trying to find passion in life. There are skills and experience you gain while traveling. It could give you lifelong personal benefits, even in the professional world. Especially when now, in college, our times are more flexible than the future. We should take advantage of our youth and freedom. </p>

    <p>	The first reason is when you travel, you are out of your comfort zone. You are entering a new world and being alone or with new people may be intimidating. However, you adapt to your surroundings, and will be able to connect with people despite of their differences. You will be able to navigate foreign environments as you become more independent. You are growing as a person. Overtime, you realize you can do things and are not afraid to be challenged anymore. </p>

    <p>	The second reason is to see life in perspective. We grow up in the comforts of the modern world and even has the opportunity to go to college. Traveling, especially to developing countries could show you not to take things for granted. Many places may not have running appliances, running hot water, or even a decent paying job. You will be more appreciative of your life. </p>

    <p>	Travelling allows you to meet new people. Imagine having friends across the globe and going there to visit them rather than just talking over on the internet. When you go volunteer, you will be able to make friends, not only with other travelers but with the local communities too. You will be able to learn about their cultures, the traditions, and beliefs. This is something you do not experience from just being on social media or watching television. There are so many multicultural societies out there. If you ever want to learn a new language, you should go to the country. You will be immerse to a new place and realize how fast your skills develop through everyday interactions. Not only will you learn the language, you might even learn deeper than that, like a dialect. Traveling allows one to immerse themselves from festivals to food. There are many unique ways people celebrate life and ancient customs! </p>

    <p>	If you want something for your resume, travelling will show you are mature and worldly experienced. Travelling shows someone has confidence and independent thinking as well as having new perspectives. Traveling also gives you the opportunity to go through the landscapes and discover natural beautiful places. You get to experience firsthand rather than on internet photos or travel brochures. </p>

    <p>	Travelling once in a while will increase happiness. Sometimes letting go of your comforts and belongings will let one relax. Maybe it is the freedom to whatever you want with no deadlines or being able to see new places and try new food. Finding the balance will make life more enjoyable.</p>
