<h1>Project Brief</h1>

 <p>My project is called Wanderluster, a visual travel log where the user travels to places and logs their adventures through their photos. Nowadays, everything could be done with the access of the internet, such as doing groceries, where fresh groceries are delivered straight to your house. My project is to encourage people to travel, find new places, and make new memories. </p>
 <p>
	According to my audience research, most people like to share their experience on social media, but also some likes to keep it private for themselves. They also like to go on adventures and come back to tell their friends and family about it. I think about incorporating the ability to share the photos you took on other social media platforms.
 </p>
 <p>
   	My app is very simple and could go for a visual appealing look or a minimalist look. The user is able to travel by inputting where they want to go and the app will link to their maps page installed in their phones. When they arrived to the location, they could log their photos by taking new photos or inputting them from the ones they have in their gallery. They are able to input the date, location, and a small description that links to the photos. The overall look will somewhat look like a photo album, except it is interactive and could share with one another.
