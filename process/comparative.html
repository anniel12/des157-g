    <p>	Traveling is something people do at least once in their lives. It makes people more open minded and helps them learn who they are despite all the challenges and opportunities. These two apps help track down all the places the user has traveled to. One of them is called “been” by Martin Johannesson and the other ones is “Countries Been” created by Daniel Knoblauch.</p>
    <p>	The “been” app has been downloaded by approximately 4,200 people, under the travel and local tab. This app helps keep track of countries the user has visited. The app has visuals of visited countries both as a list, ratio of each continent, and as a world map. It can be shared on social networks too. </p>
    <p>Just by looking at the interface, it is very clean with different shades of grey and orange. On the top, it shows the branding along with two navigators: the open to add countries and the three dots is the menu. Next is the view of the world map, showing the percentage of places the user has visited. A list appeared on the bottom, showing each countries’ name and many percentage of the country has the user visited. If the user clicks the “+” button, it will have a drop down list of all the countries in the world, and the user can check off which countries they have been to then select which cities to specify. </p>
    <p>The app is very clean and straight to the point, however, it could use some improvements such as to make it more fun and to make certain information accurate. A user complained they cannot log exactly where you have been in those countries, as some divisions do not make sense. For instance, UK is split into divisions unlike other areas that are joined. They also complained the image of the map is tiny and how some countries are missing from the list. They think it is irrelevant to share this with social media. Another improvement would be to make the app fair to all kinds of users. This app can be installed for both Android and Apple users. However, it seems on Apple, there are more features, where one can select states. On an Android, everything still runs smoothly, but the user can just select the general location only. Overall, this app is nice, but could use a lot of improvements to make it accurate and more fun.</p>

    <p>The “Countries Been” app has been downloaded by 10,035 users. This app serves a similar purpose as the previous one, to have a customized map of the world and showing all the countries and cities the user have visited, lived-in, and wanting to visit. There are more options in this app. “Countries Been” allows the user to browse the world and its places, and can add the ones the user already explored on a colorful visual checklist. The world map can be used to explore new places and learn more about them. There are images of popular sites and attractions too - useful for gathering ideas for future trips. There is also an option to share the user’s map on their social media.</p>
    <p>Just by looking at the interface, it is a lot more colorful. On the top, there is the branding, search tool, compass tool and the menu. Depending on what the user clicks, the view could be a globe, the world map, and when zoom in, different countries and states.</p>
    <p>If one clicks on the search tool, the user gets to pick which countries or cities they have been to, lived in, or want to go in the future. There is an explore option which gives information of the place, its capital and even the weather. This app have more options than the previous, but could also use some improvements. One user says they cannot download the internal states in a lot of the countries. They wanted to download countries of the UK rather than just constituent countries. The app should functions where they can track for states/provinces. Tracking bodies of water such as the oceans, seas, or lakes would be nice too. Overall, this application is very easy to use and the graphics are nice. To improve by adding more options, the customers will be more satisfy to use this app!</p>
