 <p>Travel Log is an app that the user could input data of where they went for vacation or trips. I was thinking of incorporating a GPS tracking system in there, or at least linking the destination to google maps or apple maps. That way, the user will know how many miles they have travelled. The travel log will also have an option of keeping photos where the user could look back into, somewhat like an instagram app. </p>
 <p>
When the user first opens the app, it shows 2 options, to travel or to log photos. If they pick travel, the user will input where they are from and where they are going. Then the page will pop up a google or apple maps depending on what phone they have. If my user picks log photos, there will be two options: to input photos from their gallery or to take a photo. If they input from their gallery, it will open up the photos that are already in their phones, and the user will pick which ones they want to put in the log, If the user choose to take a photo, the photo will automatically go to their log where they can input description of the image, where it is taken, and the date. Users can go back and forth to view photos.
